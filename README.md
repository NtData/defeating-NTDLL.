Today i've put my self to a new challenge , defeating ntdll.
I will be (trying) to use every Nt function in a project. 

No, i won't be going over the easy winapi functions , rather i'll be going to make the challenge even harder and go
lower and lower in levels, which means projects will only be getting harder and harder. Thanks to my friend [etwhook](https://github.com/etwhook) for giving me this idea !
All credits go to him as i'll be having him by my side if i have any questions.
